        <div class="questions">
          <h2>Who created the Octocat?</h2>
          <p>Simon Oxley is the original creator of the Octocat</p>

          <h2>How did the Octocat come to be?</h2>
          <p>
            Simon Oxley designed the octocat right around the same time that he
            created the Twitter bird, in 2006. GitHub wanted to use it for their
            logo, so they reached out to Oxley to bypass iStock rules and buy
            the rights to the Octocat directly. On Quora, GitHub co-founder PJ
            Hyett said, "Everybody seems to love the little guy. I'd be lying if
            I told you the thought of hiring someone to just do Octocat
            merchandising had never crossed my mind." Oxley says he doesn't
            clearly recollect creating the Octocat, but that he knows he used
            the head on another design, and copied and pasted it onto tentacles
            through Illustrator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oxley called it the Octopuss, but the lady, from Github, kept
            referred to it as an Octocat." Oxley said "I was like 'Really, it's
            the Octopuss,' but... I think they'd already made their mind up.
          </p>

          <h2>What is the correct capitalization for octocat?</h2>
          <p>
            When referring to the canonical Octocat, the word is capitalized.
            When describing the generic concept of an octocat or a collection of
            octocats, the word remains lowercase.
          </p>

          <h2>How did the Octocat get its name, Mona Lisa?</h2>
          <p>
            Somewhere, the date lost in the early days of GitHub, the daughter
            of one of GitHub’s developers fell in love with the Octocat. In that
            love, she wrote us a story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, there was a cat who’s name was Monalisa. Monalisa
            and her owner went to the beach. When Monalisa got to the beach, her
            owner Kelly gave her goggles so Monalisa could swim and see what was
            in the ocean. When Monalisa went in the water she found lots of
            fish. When Monalisa was swimming she was so exited she opened her
            mouth and swouloed a coral that made you grow legs like a octapus
            but keep your normal face. So Monalisa grew legs and became Mrs.
            Monalisa octocat.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we set out to define the Octocat’s personality we adopted the
            name Mona Lisa, or as you’ll hear her referred to around the GitHub
            office, simply “Mona.”
